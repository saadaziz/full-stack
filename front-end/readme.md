# front-end
- As we evolve, engineering teams are looking for ways to preserve energy and to focus that raw power. A common source of frustration can be working together on large and complex systems. Naturally, we all know that to solve a large problem, is to break it down into smaller pieces.
- How do we eat a giant avocado? 
    - We break it down into smaller and smaller chunks, until its the right size.
- Similarly, we can extend this approach to our front end.

## micro is the new trend
- For good reason, it allows us to focus on the customer journeys.
- Teams have ownership of the entire customer journey.
- Each team can accelerate outcomes safely as the surface area is reduced by incremental deployments of fine grained layers of functionality.

### high level architecture

### why micro front ends
- The main benefits we are expecting
    - Deploying independent layers without impacting other components
    - Granular releases, enabling multivariate testing
    - Components can incrementally evolve over time in the direction teams' see fit
